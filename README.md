### Content Analysis [Fur or Faux?] Explanatory Approach for Pro- and Anti-fur users in Reddit.

#### Introduction
This project analyzes user sentiment and advocacy towards animal fur on Reddit. We examined user comments on pro-fur and anti-fur subreddits to identify differences in the language used by each group. We also analyzed users' interactions in political subreddits to understand the relationship between political views and advocacy towards animal fur. Finally, we explored the relationship between users' gender and advocacy towards animal fur.

comment_count: The number of comments to be analyzed per post.

##### 2. word_frequency.py

This file is used to calculate the word frequency of the comments in the pro-fur and anti-fur subreddits. It takes the following parameters:
subreddit_name: The name of the subreddit to be analyzed.
post_count: The number of posts to be analyzed.
comment_count: The number of comments to be analyzed per post.

3. gender_interest.py

This file is used to predict the gender and interests of Reddit users. It takes the following parameters:
subreddit_name: The name of the subreddit to be analyzed.
post_count: The number of posts to be analyzed.
comment_count: The number of comments to be analyzed per post.
4. political_analysis.py

This file is used to analyze the political views of Reddit users. It takes the following parameters:

#### Results

The analysis showed that pro-fur users tend to use positive language, while anti-fur users use more negative language. Additionally, anti-fur users tend to have more interactions in political subreddits and are more likely to be classified as liberal. Finally, the analysis of gender and advocacy towards animal fur revealed that there is no significant relationship between the two.

#### Limitations

The scope of this research is limited as it only examines user comments on the fur topic and includes a limited sample size of posts from a particular time frame. As a result, the findings may not be generalizable beyond this specific group. Therefore, more extensive research is required that expands the scope and enables a comparison of similar types of thinking from different social media platforms.

#### Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into the user perspective on animal fur on Reddit. Further research can be done to expand the scope and enable a comparison of similar types of thinking from different social media platforms.
